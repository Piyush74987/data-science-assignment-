    "Ans -> A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, stored, and managed in a way that allows for\n",
    "efficient retrieval, updating, and querying of information. Databases are widely used in various applications and systems\n",
    "to store and handle large volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems (DBMS) that differ in their data models, query languages,\n",
    "and overall design philosophies:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases: SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are based on the relational data model. They store data in tables, \n",
    "which consist of rows and columns. The relationships between tables are defined using keys, such as primary keys and foreign keys.\n",
    "SQL databases use SQL as the standard language for querying and manipulating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases provide several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong data consistency and integrity.\n",
    "Well-defined schemas that enforce data consistency.\n",
    "ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure data integrity and transaction support.\n",
    "Suitable for complex queries and data relationships.\n",
    "Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle Database, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases: NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases use various data models and structures other than the traditional relational model.\n",
    "They are designed to handle large volumes of rapidly changing, unstructured, or semi-structured data. NoSQL databases offer flexibility,\n",
    "scalability, and high performance for certain use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases can be categorized into different types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document databases: Store and retrieve semi-structured data in documents, typically in JSON or XML formats. Examples include MongoDB\n",
    "and Couchbase.\n",
    "Key-value stores: Use a simple key-value data model for rapid data retrieval. Examples include Redis and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
    "Columnar databases: Organize data into columns instead of rows for efficient data compression and analytic queries. Examples include Apache\n",
    "Cassandra and Apache HBase.\n",
    "Graph databases: Store and retrieve data based on graph structures, with nodes representing entities and edges representing relationships.\n",
    "Examples include Neo4j and Amazon Neptune.\n",
    "NoSQL databases provide the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible schema that allows for agile development and schema evolution.\n",
    "Horizontal scalability and distributed architecture to handle large-scale data.\n",
    "High performance for certain types of queries, especially those involving large datasets.\n",
    "Both SQL and NoSQL databases have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements\n",
    "of an application or system. Some applications may even use a combination of both types, known as polyglot persistence, to leverage\n",
    "the benefits of each database for different aspects of the data storage and retrieval needs."

    "\n",
    "Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique. No two rows can have the same value for the primary key.\n",

    "Non-nullability: The primary key column(s) cannot contain null values. It must have a value for each row.\n",

    "fetchall() method retrieves all rows of the result set from the last executed query.\n",
    "The fetched data is processed using a loop (in this case, printed to the console).\n",
