    "True Parallelism: Unlike multithreading, multiprocessing allows for true parallel execution of tasks, as each process runs \n",
    "independently in its memory space. This is particularly beneficial for CPU-bound tasks, where performance gains can be significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing Multiple Cores: With multiprocessing, you can leverage the power of modern multi-core processors. By running processes \n",

    "Resource Sharing: Although processes run in separate memory spaces, the \"multiprocessing\" module provides mechanisms\n",

    "Scalability: Multiprocessing is scalable and can handle tasks of varying complexities. You can adjust the number of processes\n",

    "Multiprocessing and multithreading are both techniques used to achieve concurrent execution in Python, but they have significant differences in how they work and what they offer. Let's explore the main differences between multiprocessing and multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: In multiprocessing, each process runs independently in its memory space, with its own Python interpreter.\n",
    "Processes do not share memory by default, which ensures isolation between them.\n",
    "Multithreading: In multithreading, multiple threads run within the same process and share the same memory space. \n",
    "Threads have access to shared variables and data structures, which can lead to synchronization and data sharing issues.\n",
    "Parallelism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Multiprocessing provides true parallelism since each process can be executed on a separate CPU core.\n",
    "This allows for maximum utilization of multiple CPU cores for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "Multithreading: Multithreading does not provide true parallelism due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython, \n",
    "which restricts the execution of Python bytecode to a single thread at a time. This limitation makes multithreading more suitable for I/O-bound tasks rather than CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "Resource Sharing and Synchronization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Processes do not share memory by default, but the \"multiprocessing\" module provides mechanisms like pipes, queues,\n",
    "and shared memory for interprocess communication and coordination.\n",
    "Multithreading: Threads share the same memory space, allowing them to easily share data and variables. However, this shared access requires\n",
    "proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, semaphores) to avoid race conditions and ensure thread safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolation and Stability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Since processes run independently, if one process crashes, it does not affect others. This isolation enhances \n",
    "the stability and reliability of the program.\n",
    "Multithreading: Threads within the same process are tightly connected, so if one thread encounters an error (e.g., segmentation fault),\n",
    "it can crash the entire process, affecting all other threads.\n",
    "Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Implementing multiprocessing can be more complex due to the separate memory space for processes and the need for \n",
    "interprocess communication.\n",
    "Multithreading: Multithreading can be simpler to implement since threads share memory and do not require explicit communication \n",
    "mechanisms. However, handling thread synchronization and avoiding race conditions can add complexity.\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Multiprocessing is well-suited for CPU-bound tasks that can benefit from true parallel execution, especially on systems \n",
    "with multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "Multithreading: Multithreading is beneficial for I/O-bound tasks that involve waiting for I/O operations (e.g., reading/writing files,\n",
    "making network requests) since threads can continue executing other tasks during these waits.\n",
    "In summary, multiprocessing and multithreading serve different purposes and offer distinct advantages based on the nature of the tasks\n",
    "and the available hardware resources. Multiprocessing is suitable for CPU-bound tasks and parallelism, while multithreading is\n",
    "more suitable for I/O-bound tasks and responsiveness."
